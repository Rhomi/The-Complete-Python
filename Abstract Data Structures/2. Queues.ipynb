    "A queue is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items happens at one end,\n",
    "called the “rear,” and the removal of existing items occurs at the other end, commonly called\n",
    "the “front.” \n",
    "\n",
    "As an element enters the queue it starts at the rear and makes its way toward the\n",
    "front, waiting until that time when it is the next element to be removed.\n",
    "The most recently added item in the queue must wait at the end of the collection. The item that\n",
    "has been in the collection the longest is at the front. This ordering principle is sometimes called\n",
    "FIFO, first-in first-out. It is also known as “first-come first-served.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest example of a queue is the typical line that we all participate in from time to time.\n",
    "We wait in a line for a movie, we wait in the check-out line at a grocery store, and we wait in\n",
    "the cafeteria line (so that we can pop the tray stack). Well-behaved lines, or queues, are very\n",

The first task in is the next to be completed. If you are last in line, you must wait for all the other tasks to print ahead of you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to printing queues, operating systems use a number of different queues to control\n",
    "processes within a computer. The scheduling of what gets done next is typically based on\n",
    "a queuing algorithm that tries to execute programs as quickly as possible and serve as many\n",

    "are being placed in a queue-like buffer so that they can eventually be displayed on the screen\n",
