    "A stack (sometimes called a <b>\"push-down stack\"</b>) is an ordered collection of items where the\n",
    "addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end.\n",

    "\n",
    "This end is commonly referred to as the “top.” The end opposite the top is known as the “base.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The base of the stack is significant since items stored in the stack that are closer to the base\n",
    "represent those that have been in the stack the longest. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most recently added item is the one that is in position to be removed first. This ordering principle is sometimes called LIFO, last-in first-out. It provides an ordering based on length of time in the collection. \n",

The current page that you are viewing is on the top and the first page you looked at is at the base. If you click on the Back button, you begin to move in reverse order through the pages."

    "\n",
    "Now that we have clearly defined the stack as an abstract data type we will turn our attention to\n",

    "#### Important - \"Recall that when we give an abstract data type a physical implementation we refer to the implementation as a data structure.\"\n",

    "In any object-oriented programming language (we use Python here) the implementation of choice for an abstract data type such as a stack is the creation of a new <i><b>class</b></i>.\n",

    "The stack operations are implemented as <i><b>methods</b></i>.\n",

    "Further, to implement a stack, which is a collection of elements, it makes sense to utilize the power and simplicity of the primitive collections provided by Python.<b><i> We will use a list</b></i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the list class in Python provides an ordered collection mechanism and a set of\n",
    "methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have the list [2, 5, 3, 6, 7, 4], we need only to decide which end of\n",
    "the list will be considered the top of the stack and which will be the base. Once that decision is\n",
    "made, the operations can be implemented using the list methods such as append and pop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following stack implementation assumes that the end of the list will hold the top element\n",
    "of the stack. As the stack grows (as push operations occur), new items will be added on the\n",
    "end of the list. pop operations will manipulate that same end."

    "\n",
    "Without the ability to convert back and forth between common representations and binary numbers, we\n",
    "would need to interact with computers in very awkward ways.\n",

    "Integer values are common data items. They are used in computer programs and computation\n",

    "number system, or base 10. The decimal number 23310 and its corresponding binary equivalent\n",

    "25 + 0 * 24 + 1 * 23 + 0 * 22 + 0 * 21 + 1 * 20\n",
    "\n",
    "But how can we easily convert integer values into binary numbers? The answer is an algorithm\n",
    "called “Divide by 2” that uses a stack to keep track of the digits for the binary result.\n",
    "The Divide by 2 algorithm assumes that we start with an integer greater than 0. A simple iteration then continually divides the decimal number by 2 and keeps track of the remainder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first division by 2 gives information as to whether the value is even or odd. An even value\n",
    "will have a remainder of 0. It will have the digit 0 in the ones place. An odd value will have a\n",
    "remainder of 1 and will have the digit 1 in the ones place. We think about building our binary\n",

    "in the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Again we see the reversal property that signals that a stack is likely to be the appropriate data structure for solving the problem. The Python code below implements the Divide by 2 algorithm. The function divide_by_2 takes an argument that is a decimal number and repeatedly divides it by 2. Line 7 uses the built-in modulo operator, %, to extract the remainder and line 8 then pushes it on the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the division process reaches 0, a binary string is constructed. The binary digits are popped from the stack one at a time and appended to the right-hand end of the string. The binary string is then returned."
