    "Queues employ a first-in-first our enqueue dequeue approach. It has an important variation called the <b>Priority Queue</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  By Definition:\n",
    "A priority queue acts like a queue in that you dequeue an item by removing it from the front. However, in a priority queue the logical order of items inside a queue is determined by their priority. The highest priority items are at the front of the queue and the lowest priority items are at the back. Thus when you enqueue an item on a priority queue, the new item may move all the way to the front if it is of the highgest priority or even take up a position between the already existing items in the order of their priority (and therefore not necessarily the last position in the queue).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to Implement the Queue in the best possible way performance-wise?\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of easy ways to implement a priority queue is by using sorting functions and lists. However, inserting into a list is 𝑂(𝑛) and sorting a list is 𝑂(𝑛 log 𝑛). We can do better. \n",
    "\n",
    "The classic way to implement a priority queue is using a <b>data structure called a\n",
    "binary heap.</b> A binary heap will allow us both enqueue and dequeue items in <b>𝑂(log 𝑛)</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Binary Heap?\n",
    "The binary heap is a lot like a tree, but when we implement it we use only a single list as an internal representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The binary heap has two common variations: the min heap, in which the smallest key is always at the front, and the max heap, in which the largest key value is always at the front. We will implement the min heap. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go ahead with the implementation, we should understand that Binary Heaps should have certain capabilities. These are some of the operations a Binary should be able to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "• BinaryHeap() creates a new, empty, binary heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "• insert(k) adds a new item to the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "• find_min() returns the item with the minimum key value, leaving item in the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "• del_min() returns the item with the minimum key value, removing the item from the\n",
    "heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "• is_empty() returns true if the heap is empty, false otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "• size() returns the number of items in the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "• build_heap(list) builds a new heap from a list of keys."

    "## Properties of Binary Heap\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, before we implement a Binary Heap, we need to understand 2 very important properties of Binary Heaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Structure Property\n",
    "2. Order Property\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure Property.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make our heap work efficiently, we will take advantage of the <b>logarithmic nature of\n",
    "the binary tree to represent our heap</b>. In order to guarantee logarithmic performance, we must\n",
    "keep our tree <i>balanced</i>. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Balanced Binary Tree and Complete Trees\n",
    "A balanced binary tree has roughly the same number of nodes in the left and right subtrees of the root. In our heap implementation we keep the tree balanced by creating a complete binary tree. A complete binary tree is a tree in which each level has all of its nodes. The exception to this is the bottom level of the tree, which we fill in from left to right. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting property of a complete tree is that we can represent it using a single list. We\n",
    "do not need to use nodes and references or even lists of lists. Because the tree is complete, the\n",
    "left child of a parent (at position 𝑝) is the node that is found in position 2𝑝 in the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the right child of the parent is at position 2𝑝 + 1 in the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "To find the parent of any node in the tree, we can simply use Python’s integer division. Given that a node is at position 𝑛 in the list, the parent is at position 𝑛/2."

    "## Creating a Binary Heap from a List\n",
    "To finish our discussion of binary heaps, we will look at a method to build an entire heap\n",
    "from a list of keys. The first method you might think of may be like the following. Given a\n",
    "list of keys, you could easily build a heap by inserting each key one at a time. Since you are\n",
    "starting with a list of one item, the list is sorted and you could use binary search to find the\n",
    "right position to insert the next key at a cost of approximately 𝑂(log 𝑛) operations. However,\n",
    "remember that inserting an item in the middle of the list may require 𝑂(𝑛) operations to shift\n",
    "the rest of the list over to make room for the new key. Therefore, to insert 𝑛 keys into the heap\n",
    "would require a total of 𝑂(𝑛 log 𝑛) operations. However, if we start with an entire list then we\n",
    "can build the whole heap in 𝑂(𝑛) operations. The build_heap function shows the code to\n",
    "build the entire heap."
