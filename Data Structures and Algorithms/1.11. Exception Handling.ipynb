    "When an exception occurs, we say that it has been “raised.” You can “handle” the exception that has been raised by using a try statement. For example, consider the following session that asks the user for an integer and then calls the square root function from the math library. If the user enters a value that is greater than or equal to 0, the print will show the square root. However, if the user enters a negative value, the square root function will report a ValueError exception."
